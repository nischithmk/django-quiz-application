# django-quiz-application

## Overview:
The quiz application is designed to allow teachers to create quizzes and students to attend them. The application is built using Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and hosted in AWS EC2.

## Features:
* Teacher can create and manage quizzes.
* Students can attend the quizzes created by teachers.
* The quiz application has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for both teachers and students to use.
* The application is secure, with authentication and authorization implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access the application and perform actions.

## Application Architecture:
The quiz application is built using the Django web framework, which provides a solid foundation for building web applications. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern, where the Model represents the data, the View represents the presentation layer, and the Controller handles the application logic.

## Hosting:
The application is hosted in AWS EC2, which provides reliable and scalable cloud hosting. EC2 instances are created and configured to run the application, and the necessary security groups and firewall rules are set up to ensure that the application is secure.
